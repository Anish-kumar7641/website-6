        <h2>Current Game of Keeps</h2>
        <p>The current game of Keeps begins on April 15th.</p>
        <h2>Rewards</h2>
        <p>
          Judges will determine what the reward status for each entry is, in
          their sole discretion. Programs that are suggested by the judges will
          have their reward status posted.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Level 1: Up to 100,000 Keep</li>
          <li>Level 2: Up to 10,000 Keep</li>
          <li>Level 3: Up to 1,000 Keep</li>
          <li>Level 4: Up to 500 Keep</li>
          <li>Level 5: No Keep</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to severity, other variables are also considered when the
          judges decide the score, including (but not limited to):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            User Demand. Higher rewards are paid for projects that will be
            demanded by the users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quality of description. Higher rewards are paid for clear,
            well-written submissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quality of reproducibility. Please include test code, scripts and
            detailed instructions. The easier it is for us to reproduce and
            verify the vulnerability, the higher the reward. Please see the docs
            and repos to learn more about our test suite in the official{" "}

            </a>
            .
          </li>
          <li>
            Quality of fix, if included. Higher rewards are paid for submissions
            with clear description of how to fix the issue.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This Game of Keeps follows Keeps Standard Disclosure Terms, which
            are summarized here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each submission will be judged by a panel of independent judges. The
            number of selection of judges may change throughout the Game of
            Keeps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Judges will attempt to announce winners bi-weekly. However, this
            schedule may change based on a variety of factors, including the
            number of submissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Issues or projects that have already been submitted by another user
            or are already known to the Keep team are not eligible for bounty
            rewards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a
            bounty.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can start or fork a private chain for bug hunting. Please

          </li>
          <li>
            Anyone who works with the codebase as a professional Keep developer
            is not eligible for rewards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep websites or Keep Foundation infrastructure in general, are NOT
            part of the bounty program.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep bounty program considers a number of variables in determining
            rewards. Determinations of eligibility, score and all terms related
            to an award are at the sole and final discretion of the Keep
            Foundation bug bounty panel.

          If conducting vulnerability research against this program, we consider
          this research to be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

        </p>
        <h2>
          Any submissions to the Game of Keeps requires explicit permission to
          disclose the results of a submission.
        </h2>
        <h1>Standard Disclosure Terms</h1>
        <p>
          This web page represents a legal document with terms and conditions
          applicable to all individuals who have registered to participate in a
          Keep reward program. In addition, the terms and conditions contained
          in our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> (along with these
          Standard Disclosure Terms, collectively, the &ldquo;Researcher Terms
          and Conditions&rdquo;) are incorporated by reference into these
          Standard Disclosure Terms. Upon obtaining a user name with Keep, you
          are referred to as a &ldquo;Researcher&rdquo; and you are bound by and
          are obligated to comply with the Researcher Terms and Conditions.
        </p>
        <h2>The Submission Process</h2>
        <p>
          If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability, please create a
          submission for the appropriate program through the Keep platform. Each
          program has a set of guidelines called the Program Brief. The program
          brief is maintained by the Program Owner. Terms specified in the
          program brief supersede these terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each submission will be updated with significant events, including
          when the issue has been validated, when we need more information from
          you, or when you have qualified for a reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each submission is evaluated by the Program Owner on the basis of
          first-to-find. Keep may assist in the evaluation process.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will qualify for a reward if you were the first person to alert
          the Program Owner to a previously unknown issue AND the issue triggers
          a code or configuration change.
        </p>
        <h2>STANDARD PROGRAM RULES</h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to protecting the interests of Security Researchers.
          The more closely your behavior follows these rules, the more
          we&apos;ll be able to protect you if a difficult situation escalates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rules can vary for each program. Please carefully read the program
          brief for specific rules. These rules apply to all programs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Testing should be performed only on systems listed under the program
            brief &lsquo;Targets&rsquo; section. Any other systems are Out Of
            Scope.
          </li>
          <li>
            Except when otherwise noted in the program brief, you should create
            accounts for testing purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submissions must be made exclusively through Keep to be considered
            for a reward.
          </li>
          <li>
            Communication regarding submissions must remain within Keep and/or
            official Keep support channels for the duration of the disclosure
            process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Actions which affect the integrity or availability of program
            targets are prohibited and strictly enforced. If you notice
            performance degradation on the target systems, you must immediately
            suspend all use of automated tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submissions should have impact to the target&apos;s security
            posture. Impact means the reported issue affects the target&apos;s
            users, systems, or data security in a meaningful way. Submitters may
            be asked to defend the impact in order to qualify for a reward.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submissions may be closed if a Researcher is non-responsive to
            requests for information after 7 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            The existence or details of private or invitation-only programs must
            not be communicated to anyone who is not a Keep employee or an
            authorized employee of the organization responsible for the program.
          </li>
          <li>
            We encourage Researchers to include a video or screenshot
            Proof-of-Concept in their submissions. These files should not be
            shared publicly. This includes uploading to any publicly accessible
            websites (i.e. YouTube, Imgur, etc.). If the file exceeds 100MB,
            upload the file to a secure online service such as Vimeo, with a
            password.
          </li>
          <li>
            Violation of a program&apos;s stated disclosure policy may result in
            enforcement action as outlined in the Keep{" "}
            <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old or have reached the age of majority
          in your jurisdiction of primary residence and citizenship to be
          eligible to receive any monetary compensation as a Researcher.
          Additional applicable eligibility requirements are stated in the{" "}
          <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>. Exceptions with respect to a
          minor&apos;s participation in Bug Bashes may be considered on a
          case-by-case basis as between Keep and the applicable minor&apos;s
          guardian(s).
        </p>
        <h2>USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS</h2>
        <p>

          to participate in Play for Keeps. You may not use a third party&apos;s
          account without permission. When you are setting up your account, you
          must give us accurate and complete information. This means that you
          cannot set up an account using a name or contact information that does
          not apply to you, and you must provide accurate and current
          information on all registration forms that are part of the Website.
          You may only set up one account. You have complete responsibility for
          your account and everything that happens on your account. This means
          you need to be careful with your password. If you find out that
          someone is using your account without your permission, you must let us
          know immediately. You may not transfer your account to someone else.
          We are not liable for any damages or losses caused by someone using
          your account without your permission. However, if we (or anyone else)
          suffer any damage due to the unauthorized use of your account, you may
          be liable. Keep may deny the use of certain user names or require
          certain user names be changed at Keep&apos;s sole discretion and/or to
          comply with end customers&apos; requirements. User names with
          offensive or discriminatory words are prohibited.
