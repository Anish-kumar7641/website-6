        <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Emailing us at: <a href="mailto:legal@keep.network">legal@keep.network</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
        <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
          <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>

        <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
        <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
        <p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Response Timing and Format</em></strong></p>
        <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response to the email address from which you submit it.</p>
        <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</p>
        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</em></strong></p>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information so there is no reason for you to opt out of such sales.</p>
        <h2>Non-Discrimination</h2>
        <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>

          <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
          <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Other California Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section ยง 1798.83) permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose personal information for marketing purposes so there is no need to make such a request.</p>

When we make changes to this privacy notice, we will post the updated notice on the Website and update the notice's effective date. <strong>Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes</strong>.</p>
